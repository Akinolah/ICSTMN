  components/    # Reusable UI components (Navigation, Footer, AuthModal, etc.)
  context/       # React Context for global state (e.g., Auth)

### Component-Driven Construction

- **Everything is a component!**  
  Pages are composed of modular, reusable components for maintainability and scalability.
- **Example:**  
  The `Dashboard` page uses:
  - `components/Navigation` for the top nav
  - `components/Footer` for the footer
  - Custom cards, stats, and modals for user interaction
